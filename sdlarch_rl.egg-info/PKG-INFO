# sdlarch-rl

This is a fork of sdlarch that aims to develop RL projects.

## sdlarch

sdlarch is a small libretro frontend (sdlarch.c has less than 1000 lines of
code) created for educational purposes. It only provides the required (video,
audio and basic input) features to run basic libretro cores and there's no UI
or configuration support.

## Building

- Linux:

```shell
cmake .
make
```

- Windows:

```shell
cmake .
nmake
```

- [ ] Load PCSX2 States

- [ ] Load games in the same standard as stable-retro
- [ ] Improve performance
- [ ] Load another cores (Dolphin, etc)
